    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

    // A Linear Pool holds three tokens: the main token, the wrapped token, and the Pool share token (BPT). It is
    // possible to exchange any of these tokens for any of the other two (so we have three trading pairs) in both
    // directions (the first token of each pair can be bought or sold for the second) and by specifying either the input
    // or output amount (typically referred to as 'given in' or 'given out'). A full description thus requires
    // 3*2*2 = 12 functions.
    // Wrapped tokens have a known, trusted exchange rate to main tokens. All functions here assume such a rate has
    // already been applied, meaning main and wrapped balances can be compared as they are both expressed in the same
    // units (those of main token).
    // Additionally, Linear Pools feature a lower and upper target that represent the desired range of values for the
    // main token balance. Any action that moves the main balance away from this range is charged a proportional fee,
    // and any action that moves it towards this range is incentivized by paying the actor using these collected fees.
    // The collected fees are not stored in a separate data structure: they are a function of the current main balance,
    // targets and fee percentage. The main balance sans fees is known as the 'nominal balance', which is always smaller
    // than the real balance except when the real balance is within the targets.
    // The rule under which Linear Pools conduct trades between main and wrapped tokens is by keeping the sum of nominal
    // main balance and wrapped balance constant: this value is known as the 'invariant'. BPT is backed by nominal
    // reserves, meaning its supply is proportional to the invariant. As the wrapped token appreciates in value and its
    // exchange rate to the main token increases, so does the invariant and thus the value of BPT (in main token units).

/**
 * @dev Linear Pools are designed to hold two assets: "main" and "wrapped" tokens that have an equal value underlying
 * token (e.g., DAI and waDAI). There must be an external feed available to provide an exact, non-manipulable exchange
 * rate between the tokens. In particular, any reversible manipulation (e.g. causing the rate to increase and then
 * decrease) can lead to severe issues and loss of funds.
 *
 * The Pool will register three tokens in the Vault however: the two assets and the BPT itself,
 * so that BPT can be exchanged (effectively joining and exiting) via swaps.
 *
 * Despite inheriting from BasePool, much of the basic behavior changes. This Pool does not support regular joins
 * and exits, as the initial BPT supply is 'preminted' during initialization. No further BPT can be minted, and BPT can
 * only be burned if governance enables Recovery Mode and LPs use it to exit proportionally.
 *
 * Unlike most other Pools, this one does not attempt to create revenue by charging fees: value is derived by holding
 * the wrapped, yield-bearing asset. However, the 'swap fee percentage' value is still used, albeit with a different
 * meaning. This Pool attempts to hold a certain amount of "main" tokens, between a lower and upper target value.
 * The pool charges fees on trades that move the balance outside that range, which are then paid back as incentives to
 * traders whose swaps return the balance to the desired region.
 *
 * The net revenue via fees is expected to be zero: all collected fees are used to pay for this 'rebalancing'.
 * Accordingly, this Pool does not pay any protocol fees.

 *
 * @dev This is intended to provide a safe way to exit any pool during some kind of emergency, to avoid locking funds
 * in the event the pool enters a non-functional state (i.e., some code that normally runs during exits is causing
 * them to revert).
 *
 * Recovery Mode is *not* the same as pausing the pool. The pause function is only available during a short window
 * after factory deployment. Pausing can only be intentionally reversed during a buffer period, and the contract
 * will permanently unpause itself thereafter. Paused pools are completely disabled, in a kind of suspended animation,
 * until they are voluntarily or involuntarily unpaused.
 *
 * By contrast, a privileged account - typically a governance multisig - can place a pool in Recovery Mode at any
 * time, and it is always reversible. The pool is *not* disabled while in this mode: though of course whatever
 * condition prompted the transition to Recovery Mode has likely effectively disabled some functions. Rather,
 * a special "clean" exit is enabled, which runs the absolute minimum code necessary to exit proportionally.
 * In particular, stable pools do not attempt to compute the invariant (which is a complex, iterative calculation
 * that can fail in extreme circumstances), and no protocol fees are collected.
 *
 * It is critical to ensure that turning on Recovery Mode would do no harm, if activated maliciously or in error.

/**
 * @dev Library for encoding and decoding values stored inside a 256 bit word. Typically used to pack multiple values in
 * a single storage slot, saving gas by performing less storage accesses.
 *
 * Each value is defined by its size and the least significant bit in the word, also known as offset. For example, two
 * 128 bit values may be encoded in a word by assigning one an offset of 0, and the other an offset of 128.
 *
 * We could use Solidity structs to pack values together in a single storage slot instead of relying on a custom and
 * error-prone library, but unfortunately Solidity only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or
 * memory. Because a memory struct uses not just memory but also a slot in the stack (to store its memory location),
 * using memory for word-sized values (i.e. of 256 bits or less) is strictly less gas performant, and doesn't even
 * prevent stack-too-deep issues. This is compounded by the fact that Balancer contracts typically are memory-intensive,
 * and the cost of accesing memory increases quadratically with the number of allocated words. Manual packing and
 * unpacking is therefore the preferred approach.
