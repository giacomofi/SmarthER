 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.
 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply
 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.

 * @title CompanyName AG Shares

 *
 * These tokens represent ledger-based securities according to article 973d of the Swiss Code of Obligations.
 * This smart contract serves as an ownership registry, enabling the token holders to register them as
 * shareholders in the issuer's shareholder registry. This is equivalent to the traditional system
 * of having physical share certificates kept at home by the shareholders and a shareholder registry run by
 * the company. Just like with physical certificates, the owners of the tokens are the owners of the shares.
 * However, in order to exercise their rights (for example receive a dividend), shareholders must register
 * themselves. For example, in case the company pays out a dividend to a previous shareholder because
 * the current shareholder did not register, the company cannot be held liable for paying the dividend to
 * the "wrong" shareholder. In relation to the company, only the registered shareholders count as such.
