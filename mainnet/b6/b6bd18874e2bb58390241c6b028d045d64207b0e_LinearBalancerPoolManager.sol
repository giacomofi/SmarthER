    //
    // - Whenever documentation refers to 'tokens', it strictly refers to ERC20-compliant token contracts. Tokens are
    // transferred out of the Vault by calling the `IERC20.transfer` function, and transferred in by calling
    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.
    // Contracts calling view functions in the Vault must make sure the Vault has not already been entered.
    //
    // - View functions revert if referring to either unregistered Pools, or unregistered tokens for registered Pools.

    // Authorizer
    //
    // Some system actions are permissioned, like setting and collecting protocol fees. This permissioning system exists
    // outside of the Vault in the Authorizer contract: the Vault simply calls the Authorizer to check if the caller
    // can perform a given action.

    // Relayers
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible for an account to perform certain actions on behalf of another one, using their
    // Vault ERC20 allowance and Internal Balance. These accounts are said to be 'relayers' for these Vault functions,
    // and are expected to be smart contracts with sound authentication mechanisms. For an account to be able to wield
    // this power, two things must occur:
    //  - The Authorizer must grant the account the permission to be a relayer for the relevant Vault function. This
    //    means that Balancer governance must approve each individual contract to act as a relayer for the intended
    //    functions.
    //  - Each user must approve the relayer to act on their behalf.
    // This double protection means users cannot be tricked into approving malicious relayers (because they will not
    // have been allowed by the Authorizer via governance), nor can malicious relayers approved by a compromised
    // Authorizer or governance drain user funds, since they would also need to be approved by each individual user.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.
