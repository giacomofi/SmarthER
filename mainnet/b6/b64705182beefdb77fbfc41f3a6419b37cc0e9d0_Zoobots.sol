I further certify that at the dated time of this NFT's creation, I possess all necessary rights to the work to issue the associated NFT and to create the licenses and terms explained in this document. I pledge that I shall create no further NFT or materially identical cryptographic instrument representing this same work without the written consent of the present owner, and agree that the present owner of the NFT may publicly state their ownership of the NFT and my association with its creation, as well as my association with and creation of the associated work. I enter into these terms freely and willingly and pledge to uphold them to the reasonable extent of my ability.

// As the Creator of this NFT and the associated work, I make the following warrants and grants and assume the associated obligations toward whomever the current owner of the packaged NFT might be, provided that they uphold the Owner Obligations and Royalties to the reasonable extent of their ability:
// I warrant that this NFT is and shall remain a unique collectible asset to the reasonable extent of my ability to ensure this outcome, and I hereby forfeit my right to create another NFT or functionally identical cryptographic instrument of this specific work without the written consent of the present owner as my means of ensuring performance of this clause.
