 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC20` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 * For a generic mechanism see `ERC20Mintable`.
 *
 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply
 * mechanisms](https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226).*
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.

 * @title Recoverable
 * In case of tokens that represent real-world assets such as shares of a company, one needs a way
 * to handle lost private keys. With physical certificates, courts can declare share certificates as
 * invalid so the company can issue replacements. Here, we want a solution that does not depend on
 * third parties to resolve such cases. Instead, when someone has lost a private key, he can use the
 * declareLost function on the recovery hub to post a deposit and claim that the shares assigned to a
 * specific address are lost.
 * If an attacker trying to claim shares belonging to someone else, they risk losing the deposit
 * as it can be claimed at anytime by the rightful owner.
 * Furthermore, if "getClaimDeleter" is defined in the subclass, the returned address is allowed to
 * delete claims, returning the collateral. This can help to prevent obvious cases of abuse of the claim
 * function, e.g. cases of front-running.
 * Most functionality is implemented in a shared RecoveryHub.
