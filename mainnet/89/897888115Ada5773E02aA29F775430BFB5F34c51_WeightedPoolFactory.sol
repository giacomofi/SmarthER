    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by
    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning
    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.
    //
    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.
    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View
    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

    // Swaps
    //
    // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
    // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
    // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
    //
    // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.

/**
 * @notice Reference implementation for the base layer of a Pool contract.
 * @dev Reference implementation for the base layer of a Pool contract that manages a single Pool with optional
 * Asset Managers, an admin-controlled swap fee percentage, and an emergency pause mechanism.
 *
 * This Pool pays protocol fees by minting BPT directly to the ProtocolFeeCollector instead of using the
 * `dueProtocolFees` return value. This results in the underlying tokens continuing to provide liquidity
 * for traders, while still keeping gas usage to a minimum since only a single token (the BPT) is transferred.
 *
 * Note that neither swap fees nor the pause mechanism are used by this contract. They are passed through so that
 * derived contracts can use them via the `_addSwapFeeAmount` and `_subtractSwapFeeAmount` functions, and the
 * `whenNotPaused` modifier.
 *
 * No admin permissions are checked here: instead, this contract delegates that to the Vault's own Authorizer.
 *
 * Because this contract doesn't implement the swap hooks, derived contracts should generally inherit from
 * BaseGeneralPool or BaseMinimalSwapInfoPool. Otherwise, subclasses must inherit from the corresponding interfaces
 * and implement the swap callbacks themselves.

 * @dev Library for encoding and decoding values stored inside a 256 bit word. Typically used to pack multiple values in

 *
 * We could use Solidity structs to pack values together in a single storage slot instead of relying on a custom and

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

 * Recovery Mode is *not* the same as pausing the pool. The pause function is only available during a short window
 * after factory deployment. Pausing can only be intentionally reversed during a buffer period, and the contract
 * will permanently unpause itself thereafter. Paused pools are completely disabled, in a kind of suspended animation,
 * until they are voluntarily or involuntarily unpaused.
 *
 * By contrast, a privileged account - typically a governance multisig - can place a pool in Recovery Mode at any
 * time, and it is always reversible. The pool is *not* disabled while in this mode: though of course whatever
 * condition prompted the transition to Recovery Mode has likely effectively disabled some functions. Rather,
 * a special "clean" exit is enabled, which runs the absolute minimum code necessary to exit proportionally.
 * In particular, stable pools do not attempt to compute the invariant (which is a complex, iterative calculation
 * that can fail in extreme circumstances), and no protocol fees are collected.
 *
 * It is critical to ensure that turning on Recovery Mode would do no harm, if activated maliciously or in error.
