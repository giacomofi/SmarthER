    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do

/**
 * @title Timelock Authorizer
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @dev Authorizer with timelocks (delays).
 *
 * Users are allowed to perform actions if they have the permission to do so.
 *
 * This Authorizer implementation allows defining a delay per action identifier. If a delay is set for an action, users
 * are instead allowed to schedule an execution that will be run in the future by the Authorizer instead of executing it
 * directly themselves.
 *
 * Glossary:
 * - Action: Operation that can be performed to a target contract. These are identified by a unique bytes32 `actionId`
 *   defined by each target contract following `IAuthentication.getActionId`.
 * - Scheduled execution: The Authorizer can define different delays per `actionId` in order to determine that a
 *   specific time window must pass before these can be executed. When a delay is set for an `actionId`, executions
 *   must be scheduled. These executions are identified with an unsigned integer called `scheduledExecutionId`.
 * - Permission: Unique identifier to refer to a user (who) that is allowed to perform an action (what) in a specific
 *   target contract (where). This identifier is called `permissionId` and is computed as
 *   `keccak256(actionId, account, where)`.
 *
 * Permission granularity:
 *   In addition to the who/what/where of a permission, an extra notion of a "specifier" is introduced to enable more
 *   granular configuration. This concept is used within the Authorizer to provide clarity among four ambiguous actions:
 *   granting/revoking permissions, executing scheduled actions, and setting action delays. For example, in managing
 *   the permission to set action delays, it is desirable to delineate whether an account can set delays for all
 *   actions indiscriminately or only for a specific action ID. In this case, the permission's "baseActionId" is the
 *   action ID for scheduling a delay change, and the "specifier" is the action ID for which the delay will be changed.
 *   The "baseActionId" and "specifier" of a permission are combined into a single "extended" `actionId`
 *   by calling `getExtendedActionId(baseActionId, specifier)`.
 *
 * Note that the TimelockAuthorizer doesn't make use of reentrancy guards on the majority of external functions.
 * The only function which makes an external non-view call (and so could initate a reentrancy attack) is `execute`
 * which executes a scheduled execution and so this is the only protected function.
 * In fact a number of the TimelockAuthorizer's functions may only be called through a scheduled execution so reentrancy
 * is necessary in order to be able to call these.
