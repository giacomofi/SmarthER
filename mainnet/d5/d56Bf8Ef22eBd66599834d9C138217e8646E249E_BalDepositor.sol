  // Swaps
  //
  // Users can swap tokens with Pools by calling the `swap` and `batchSwap` functions. To do this,
  // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be
  // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
  //
  // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
  // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
  // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
  // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
  // individual swaps.
  //
  // There are two swap kinds:
  //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
  // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
  //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
  // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
  //
  // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
  // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
  // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
  // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
  // the final intended token.
  //
  // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
  // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
  // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
  // much less gas than they would otherwise.
  //
  // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
  // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
  // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
  //
  // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
  // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
  // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
  //
  // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
  // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
  //
  // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
  // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be
  // passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is possible to combine ETH and WETH in the
  // same swap. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is relevant for relayers).
  //
  // Finally, Internal Balance can be used when either sending or receiving tokens.
