     * @dev Performs a series of swaps with one or multiple Pools. In each individual swap, the caller determines either
     * the amount of tokens sent to or received from the Pool, depending on the `kind` value.
     *
     * Returns an array with the net Vault asset balance deltas. Positive amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent to the
     * Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at
     * the same index in the `assets` array.
     *
     * Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a
     * Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or
     * `amountOut` depending on the swap kind.
     *
     * Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out
     * of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal
     * the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`.
     *
     * The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses,
     * or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and
     * out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to
     * or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault.
     *
     * Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies
     * the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer.
     *
     * `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the
