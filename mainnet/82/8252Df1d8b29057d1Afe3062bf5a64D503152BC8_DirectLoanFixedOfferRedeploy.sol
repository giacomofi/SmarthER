 *
 * Main contract for NFTfi Direct Loans Fixed Type. This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed
 * peer-to-peer loans of type Fixed (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan) where the borrower pays the
 * maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.
 *
 * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:
 *
 * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.
 *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their
 * be1alf.
 *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their
 * behalf.
 *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.
 *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in
 * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an
 * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the
 * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt
 * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.
 *
 * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.
 *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their
 * be1alf.
 *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their
 * behalf.
 *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.
 *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is
 * stored in the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender
 * receives an NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest,
 * or the underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation
 * receipt (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.
 *
 * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that
 * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that
 * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.
 *
 * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that
 * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral
 * back.
 *
 *
 * A loan may end in one of two ways:
 * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they
 * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.
 * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call
 * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the
 * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.

     * @param _loanId - The unique identifier for the loan to be renegotiated

     * @param _newMaximumRepaymentAmount - The new maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to
     * retrieve their collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan. The
     * borrower will always have to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay
     * early.

     * the admin for the renegotiation, has to be paid with an ERC20 transfer loanERC20Denomination token,

     * referring instead to nonces that are used by both the lender and the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonces can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     * - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     * - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun()
     , which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains
     * that nonce.
     * @param _expiry - The date when the renegotiation offer expires
     * @param _lenderSignature - The ECDSA signature of the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the

     * @param _offer - The offer struct containing:
     * - loanERC20Denomination: The address of the ERC20 contract of the currency being used as principal/interest
     * for this loan.
     * - loanPrincipalAmount: The original sum of money transferred from lender to borrower at the beginning of
     * the loan, measured in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
     * - maximumRepaymentAmount: The maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to retrieve their
     * collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan. The borrower will always have
     * to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay early.
     * - nftCollateralContract: The address of the ERC721 contract of the NFT collateral.
     * - nftCollateralId: The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for the NFT being used as collateral for this
     * loan. The NFT is stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
     * - referrer: The address of the referrer who found the lender matching the listing, Zero address to signal
     * this there is no referrer.
     * - loanDuration: The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can liquidate the
     * loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints: This is the interest rate (measured in basis points, e.g.
     * hundreths of a percent) for the loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the conclusion of the loan
     * or risk seizure of their nft collateral. Note if the type of the loan is fixed then this value  is not used and
     * is irrelevant so it should be set to 0.
     * - loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints: The percent (measured in basis points) of the interest earned that will be
     * taken as a fee by the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored in the loan struct to prevent an
     * attack where the contract admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and take all of the interest
     * earned.

     * - nonce: The nonce referred here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce.
     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     *   - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     *   - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling
     * NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from
     * using the user's off-chain order that contains that nonce.
