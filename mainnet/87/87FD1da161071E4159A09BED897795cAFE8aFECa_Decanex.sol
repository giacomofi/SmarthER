INTRODUCTION

When Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021, everyone was left scratching their brains for a while. 

Blockchain technology has already ushered in a revolution around the world. The world has turned to blockchain and is investing and earning through it.

Metaverse is a fully immersive and interactive VR experience with its own economy, currency,social network, and governance system.

The idea is going standard, and many organizations embrace the innovation. Metaverse is the alternate virtual world that, along with augmented reality, exceeds physical reality.

Metaverse platform with gaming and NFT alternatives. Users can make money, develop networks, purchase and trade NFTs, virtually socialize and the sky is the limit from here.
 
The Decanex, a virtual social space, is a tokenized decentralized Metaverse theme park comprising 12 zones, 9 themes and 3 virtual properties. We want to oer enormous and limitless opportunities for engagement and futuristic growth of users in Metaverse.

We are committed to rendering innovative contemporary solutions to our users. To do so, we are coming up with a virtual theme city, a gaming and NFTs platform â€“ Decanex. Decanex will be a decentralised metaverse theme park containing 12 zones and 9 themes. Our theme park will be a land for Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Bitcoins.

Decanex - a tokenized, decentralized Metaverse Theme Park will have

12 ZONES. 09 themes. 03 properties



MARKET ANALYSIS

Metaverse will be executed via blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies will play a significant part in its development. 

With the launch of Ethereum 2.0, analysts such as Wallet Investor, anticipate that the average price of Ethereum may reach about $8,000 by the end of 2022, $10,000 in 2023, and more than $16,000 by 2025. 

In the last few years, the crypto business has seen tremendous expansion. More institutional investors entering the market have aided the distribution and growth of cryptocurrencies.


As a result, in June 2021, the total number of global crypto users surpassed 300 million. We are now expecting the international mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the coming years. 

According to investors and analytics businesses, sales of real estate in the Metaverse surpassed $500 million last yearand are expected to more than quadruple this year.

In the aftermath of the pandemic, we are already living in a semi-meta world.

With schools, colleges, and oces going online and companies all over the world recognizing and adopting the new culture of working from home in a virtual environment; the Metaverse appears to be a step forward towards the new revolution at this time. The 3D gaming and interactive media industries are well-established. According to analysts, the 3D gaming consoles market will grow at a 15% CAGR from 2021 to 2026.


The next major component of blockchain technology in the gaming business is NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Collectible NFTs, according to gaming experts, is an essential element of the gaming industry's future. 

NFTs enable ownership, interoperability, and immutability. NFTs are independent and verifiable means to own unique digital collectibles. It is an easy way to own copyrights. 

Blockchain networks here help create and deploy NFTs within multiple gaming environments. According to statistics, the overall market value of NFTs is around $31.4 billion, accounting for 1.53 percent of the current $2.05 trillion global market cap for cryptocurrencies.

The Brandessence Market Research Company's global Metaverse market valuation is expected to reach $596 billion by 2027, which is at a CAGR of 44.8%

PROBLEMS IN METAVERSE UNIVERSE

1- ntellectual property ownership is one of them. If the content creator is an AI, you may not get intellectual property protection. In this case, you cannot claim the legal rights of your work. 

2- The security issues on Metaverse need improvements. You 2 may learn more about how the platform will use your data.

3- The ownership of digital assets is challenging to verify. Letâ€™s say you made money virtually. You will need to prove that itâ€™s yours.

4- Lack of Ai-supported sowares to help users in Metaverse.


SOLUTIONS BY Decanex

1- Decanex will be governed by DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanism and powered by its native Decanex token. DAO is where rules encoded as smart contracts execute the agreed-upon decisions automatically. It eradicates the chances of any fraud.

2- Decanex token holders will also be having governance rights, where they can exercise voting rights on the main decisions of the Decanex ecosystem. 

3- Advanced integrated soware like SDK to ensure the functionality of the platform, also making it user-friendly. 

4- Ethereum blockchain on layer 2 will be used to verify the ownership and ensure scalability which also functions as a Proof of stake.

5- All in one place for all Metaverse experiences.

6- Providing an NFT marketplace and NFT usage in gaming.


Meta ( form erly known as meta)

Meta is investing $150 million to train the next generation of creators to build 
immersive learning content, the company announced at the Oculus Connect 
event.

PLATFORM FEATURES

Decanex will be a layer 2 solution built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

We believe layer 2 is the future of blockchain technology and can help accelerate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. Layer 2 solutions are helpful both in terms of scaling and fee structure. Our blockchain solutions will be secure and safe for the users and investors since they inherit the underlying security of the main chain, i.e., Ethereum.

Decanex will be a robust one-of-a-kind blockchain-based Metaverse platform due to the unique experience it will provide. We intend to launch the platform in multiple stages. 

In each phase, we will continue to introduce more exciting content for the consumers. We will launch the alpha version with five theme parks; users will have access to them and will be able to transact and store their digital assets. They will also engage with other asset creators, as well as sell and monetize their assets on the platform. Smart contracts will be used to handle everything on the site. Hence people can trust the system. Decanex tokens are only accepted for in-game currency. These are the primary utility tokens, and users will be able to purchase and sell assets. 



Decanex GAME MAKER


The Decanex platform intends to give users access to a variety of landscapes, interactions, attractions, hubs, and games. Furthermore, individuals may participate here using their own avatars and share their experiences with a large community of like-minded people. We will oer a Game Maker that will let you develop, build, test, and share games and other experiences with the Decanex Metaverse. The Game Maker will be a simple tool to use. There will be a massive library of community-developed resources, and using the Game Maker, creators can place characters, customize buildings, display items, and create grand quests. Creators can utilize the SDK soware to create 3D games and NFTs directly. SDK is for designers, creators, and animators. They can purchase assets from Decanex asset stores, load them into SDK, and create their solutions. If implemented properly, the functionality will encourage community growth, increase collaborations, and accelerate the overall development of the Decanex platform.


ASSETS STORE AND NFT MARKETPLACE

Within the platform, we will have an integrated asset store and an NFT marketplace. An NFT marketplace enhances the user experience and allows for quick asset tokenization. Developers do not need to know how to code; they may build a token in minutes and integrate it into the platform immediately. Users may sell or show their NFTs in the NFT marketplace to monetize their talent. 

NFTs are stored securely, can be sold fairly, and provide buyers with actual ownership control. To facilitate all transactions, smart contracts will be utilized. Through Avatars, the NFT marketplace will also make it much easier to network and hold social events. An asset store will be a platform to accommodate gaming assets, gaming characters, and gaming accessories to help game designers to make their creations alive in no time.


Decanex BLOCKCHAIN

A single dex to swap tokens across Decanex blockchain smart contracts for digital marketing and social media decentralization through the governance of blockchain using DAO and voting system to reduce transaction fees and layer 2 scalable solutions on top of Ethereum blockchain.



Decanex LAND â€“ VIRTUAL LAND PROJECT

Decanex will also be a real estate project wherein we are keeping a part of the total land as open blocks for sale.

These will be tokenized plots of land. Users will be able to get these digital pieces of real estate on an open sea platform and can be the owners. These owners, in turn, can upgrade these plots over time using the resources and craing ingredients that can be found inside the platform.

Each piece of land will be a unique, non-fungible ERC-721 token on the blockchain. These virtual plots can be purchased using the native Decanex token of the Metaverse. A district can be created by joining 3 or more pieces of plots.

9 THEME PARKS 10,000 Plots Each. 3 ISLANDS 5,000 Plots Each. 105000 PLOTS TOTAL

Available Plot Sizes     50-50  120-120  240*240  600*600

All pieces of land surrounding major partners or social places will be considered premium land. These places will experience more traffic from users and other players.

All advertisements and billboards placed on the premium land will be more visible. More traffic will bring more engagement anc higher monetization potential for owners.
