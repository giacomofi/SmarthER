Hey you. 

Yeah you. 

Look at you go! Checking on-chain. 

Dad would be proud.

But there's a problem.

DeFi is dead. 

Yeah. Roll your eyes all you want. 

It won't change the truth.

The truth is that only a handful of you on-chain degens remain.

The rest is a bunch of pump and dump whale money and scammers.

It fucking sucks. I know. I'm sick of it.

The glory days of DeFi are long gone and now it's an std-filled pvp orgy.

There's still hope for another bull run. Yay! Some new exit liquidity! Right? 

But that shit is far in the future. Late 2023-2024.

And it's possible SBF and Co fuck us beforehand with regulatory bs to protect what they built before then.

So yeah. Pretty shitty situation we're in. 

I decided to make this token to raise awareness of the reality of our situation and cut the crap.

Give you handful of degens some real talk and maybe a few x's, but probably not.

Because let's be honest, most of these are just p&d's with momentum driven initially by sniper and bot buys.

^Ready to dump on you after liq is locked and contract renounced.

And because of that, I'm not going to promise anything.

No paid marketing, no official Telegram, Twitter, etc. If you'd like to make them, feel free. 

Although I have previously built and run successful projects, it's hard to build a community right now, especially with the lack of like-minded degens around. 

So yeah. DeFi is dead. Maybe a bull run in a couple years. No promises. 

If you'd like to still take a gamble on my token, here are the details:

- stealth launch on uniswap shortly after deploy (~30 mins) 
- buy/sell fees are 3/3
- 2% max wallet (20000000)
- if you snipe or bot, you will be rekt 
- lock liquidity and renounce at x2 - will extend for each x we go up 

Note:

If we don't hit x2, I'm pulling the liquidity.

Keep in mind that it's my own personal funds that I'm providing as liquidity. 

I'm not going to let them sit there for a dead token. 

You shouldn't either. Move on.

-Ry
