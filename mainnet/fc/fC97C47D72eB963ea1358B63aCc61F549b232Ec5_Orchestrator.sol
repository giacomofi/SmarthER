 * invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well
 * as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance.
 * WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke
 * a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent,
 * because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.
