About us

We are a group of people from different backgrounds united by passion for technology (especially for the blockchain), we are always looking for new innovative solutions and we fit each other skills by covering different roles.

Besides our passion for technology, we are also passionate about various beverages and plan to create the first coffee shop available in the real world (through the creation and promotion on our own e-commerce platform) and on the Metaverse.

The team is made up of people from all over the world and is ready to join forces in order to achieve this inspiring and ambitious goal.

About Omnicrypt

Omnicrypt is a combination between the real world and the metaverse. The first coffee shop is available in three different versions:
1) Omnicrypt token for crypto lovers and investors.
2) Our drinks are available on our e-commerce platform.
3) Omnicrypt virtual drinks available in Metaverse.

coffee shop Function

A special function that will help to obtain several resources for marketing and listing on famous exchange platforms, as well as to maintain a stable graph through buy back of the token by our team. 

A part of these tokens will be burned, while the remaining ones will be used for special marketing campaigns to help promoting and let new people learn more about our token. 

E-Commerce

A revolutionary e-commerce platform where users will be able to make transactions with classical currencies (euro, dollars, yuan, etc.), the most popular crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.) and, most importantly, with Omnicrypt token.

Those using our token will enjoy some convenient discounts, and it will help to increase the number of transactions. 

You might be thinking: "many people have no idea how to use tools such as Metamask or Trustwallet, some do not even know that they exist! How can they manage to purchase our token on our e-commerce?"

Well, we also thought about that and through a simple transaction even those who have no previous knowledge of these tools will be able to buy with maximum simplicity. 

Metaverse

The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life.
Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies, often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.
Stephenson depicts the Metaverse as an immense black sphere with a circumference of 65536 km (216), divided in two parts at the height of the Equator from a viable route also on a monorail with 256 (28) stations, each of 256 km distance. On this sphere each person can create in 3D whatever he/she wants: shops, offices, nightclub, etc. and all is completely available to users who are interested to visit.
We want to create our first coffee shop in Metaverse so that every user can enjoy our virtual coffee shop in the future.

beverages

Currently, we have various plans to produce and distribute high-quality beverages such as juice, energy drinks, mocktails, milkshakes, smoothies, and other beverages in the near future. Also, in addition to physical drinks, we are trying to create a metaverse environment to create our own coffee shop so that our users can buy and enjoy beautiful drinks in special glasses through our metaverse coffee shop.

Rewards

A special function designed to reward with ETH those investors who own a certain amount of Omnicrypt token and believe in our project with a long term commitment. We will obviously recognize a larger reward to those who hold more tokens than others, so that they can feel gratified and more engaged in the project.

Vip Group

An exclusive group for those who joined the private sale or own a significant amount of Omnicrypt token. Being part of this group will grant you to receive the latest news in advance and actively participate to some of the most important decisions of the Omnicrypt team.
