@title Yearn Token Vault
@author yearn.finance
@notice
    Yearn Token Vault. Holds an underlying token, and allows users to interact
    with the Yearn ecosystem through Strategies connected to the Vault.
    Vaults are not limited to a single Strategy, they can have as many Strategies
    as can be designed (however the withdrawal queue is capped at 20.)
    Deposited funds are moved into the most impactful strategy that has not
    already reached its limit for assets under management, regardless of which
    Strategy a user's funds end up in, they receive their portion of yields
    generated across all Strategies.
    When a user withdraws, if there are no funds sitting undeployed in the
    Vault, the Vault withdraws funds from Strategies in the order of least
    impact. (Funds are taken from the Strategy that will disturb everyone's
    gains the least, then the next least, etc.) In order to achieve this, the
    withdrawal queue's order must be properly set and managed by the community
    (through governance).
    Vault Strategies are parameterized to pursue the highest risk-adjusted yield.
    There is an "Emergency Shutdown" mode. When the Vault is put into emergency
    shutdown, assets will be recalled from the Strategies as quickly as is
    practical (given on-chain conditions), minimizing loss. Deposits are
    halted, new Strategies may not be added, and each Strategy exits with the
    minimum possible damage to position, while opening up deposits to be
    withdrawn by users. There are no restrictions on withdrawals above what is
    expected under Normal Operation.
    For further details, please refer to the specification:
    https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-vaults/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md

        Measuring quantity of shares to issues is based on the total
        outstanding debt that this contract has ("expected value") instead
        of the total balance sheet it has ("estimated value") has important
        security considerations, and is done intentionally. If this value were
        measured against external systems, it could be purposely manipulated by
        an attacker to withdraw more assets than they otherwise should be able
        to claim by redeeming their shares.
        On deposit, this means that shares are issued against the total amount
        that the deposited capital can be given in service of the debt that
        Strategies assume. If that number were to be lower than the "expected
        value" at some future point, depositing shares via this method could
        entitle the depositor to *less* than the deposited value once the
        "realized value" is updated from further reports by the Strategies
        to the Vaults.
        Care should be taken by integrators to account for this discrepancy,
        by using the view-only methods of this contract (both off-chain and
        on-chain) to determine if depositing into the Vault is a "good idea".

        ordering and behavior.
    @dev
        Measuring the value of shares is based on the total outstanding debt
        that this contract has ("expected value") instead of the total balance
        sheet it has ("estimated value") has important security considerations,
        and is done intentionally. If this value were measured against external
        systems, it could be purposely manipulated by an attacker to withdraw
        more assets than they otherwise should be able to claim by redeeming
        their shares.
        On withdrawal, this means that shares are redeemed against the total
        amount that the deposited capital had "realized" since the point it
        was deposited, up until the point it was withdrawn. If that number
        were to be higher than the "expected value" at some future point,
        withdrawing shares via this method could entitle the depositor to
        *more* than the expected value once the "realized value" is updated
        from further reports by the Strategies to the Vaults.
        Under exceptional scenarios, this could cause earlier withdrawals to
        earn "more" of the underlying assets than Users might otherwise be
        entitled to, if the Vault's estimated value were otherwise measured
        through external means, accounting for whatever exceptional scenarios
        exist for the Vault (that aren't covered by the Vault's own design.)
        In the situation where a large withdrawal happens, it can empty the
        vault balance and the strategies in the withdrawal queue.
        Strategies not in the withdrawal queue will have to be harvested to
        rebalance the funds and make the funds available again to withdraw.
