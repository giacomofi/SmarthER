Authored by: Giacomo Ibba, Sabrina Aufiero, Rumyana Neykova, Roberto Tonelli, Marco Ortu, Giuseppe Destefanis

This repository aims to collect a significant sample of smart contracts with associated vulnerability reports, and traditional software metrics extracted from each smart contract. 
The repository contains:
- Smart contracts source code.
- The vulnerability report was built with Slither for each contract.
- Traditional software metrics extracted from each contract.
